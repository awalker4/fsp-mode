# fsp-mode

FSP (finite state processes) is a process algebra notation as described in the book Concurrency by Magee and Kramer. FSP is used in conjunction with the [Labeled State Transition Analyzer Tool](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/ltsa/) (LTSA) to verify the safety of concurrent systems.

I'm currently taking a formal models class covering FSP notation. I also recently fell in love with the power and extensibility of Emacs, so I thought it would be fun to try to combine the two things.

A quick Google search turns up [fsp-mode.el](http://cs.au.dk/~esbena/fsp-mode.el) written by Esben Andreasen in 2009. It's a good start, though I'd like to see if I can take it farther when I have the time. For now, this repo just holds a copy of Esben's original file.
